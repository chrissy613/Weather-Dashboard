# Weather-Dashboard
I was able to code out the search function so I customized it to fit each the city buttons. Two things I couldn't figure out: 
1. How to make the search query turn into a button in the left sidebar. 
2. How to store the weather information in localstorage. 
After I coded out the present day forecast, modifying that code to create the five day forecast wasn't difficult.
